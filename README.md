- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsag87
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff, more than time allows me to, but coding and electronics always have a special place in my heart. That's why I'm here!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, well, relearning and expanding my C++ knowledge, which is my all-time favourite coding language, along with C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can, and with whoever wants my help!
- 📫 How to reach me ... just drop me an email or a message. I'll be happy to answer!
